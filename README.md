# Steins-Gate-Discord-Bot

A Steins;Gate themed Discord bot originally made to support larger emojis, as Discord does not support custom emojis larger than 32x32.

This bot displays larger "emojis" as message attachments when an emoji command is given. Additional functionality includes playing audio messages when prompted or when a user joins a specific voice channel.

Type ~help for a list of commands and emojis.

Required local dependencies:
- Windows build tools: https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools (to compile native node modules, e.g. node-opus)
- ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
